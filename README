Supercomputer Log Analysis Framework (SLAF)
SLAF is a set of Python scripts meant for analyzing MOAB logs, and failure databases from Titan supercomputer.
Original developers: Esteban Meneses (esteban.meneses@acm.org) and Xiang Ni (xiangni2@illinois.edu)

Here is a short description of each file in this directory:



-> correlate.py: determines what percentage of job ids in the failure log can be traced back to the MOAB logs.
failjobs.py: creates a report that correlates failures with job information.
-> mtbf.py: computes a histogram for the MTBF in the failure database.
-> stats.py: creates a report from a particular column in the failure log.

RUNNING

-> FAILURE STATISTICS
* Generating a distribution of the mean-time-between-failures (MTBF) from a failure database:
python mtbf.py dir/Titan.2014.failures.txt mtbf.pdf 300 50
* Creating a distribution for failures according to the a particular variable: 
python stats.py dir/Titan.2014.failures.txt 5
(an output file category.pdf will be generated)

-> WORKLOAD AND FAILURE CORRELATION
* Checking how reliably failure information can be track down to workload records:
python correlate.py dir/Titan.2014.failures.january.txt dir/2014_january/

-> IMPACT 
* Enriching a list of filtered failures with the features on the failure database:
python extract.py dir/Titan.2014.failures.txt filterFailures_advanced filtered_failures.txt
* Generating job dataset:
python failjobs.py filtered_failures.txt dir/2014/ 2014.txt
* Generating plots:
python generate_impact.py 2014.txt 2014_failures 50
